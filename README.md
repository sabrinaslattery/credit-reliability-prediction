<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is my first attempt at using machine learning models to show predictive data. <br />
Here, I determine the liklihood of a credit card owner to default on their payments. Using both Decision Tree and Random Forest models I concluded that a Random Forest model would be the better choice, having better performance and scalability than the Decision Tree model. Using feature analysis, I determined that the features most likely to produce accurate predictions would be the credit card owner's bill ("Bill" feature variables) amount over a five-month period.<br />

In conclusion, using a Random Forest model and a credit card owner's bill amount over a five-month period would give the best prediction of whether or not that credit card user will default on their credit card payments. <br /><br />
This is my first attempt at ML modeling, so feel free to leave feedback and suggestions in my [Issues](https://github.com/sabrinaslattery/credit-reliability-prediction/issues) tab!


### Built Using

* Python
* MATLAB, Scikit-Learn, Imbalanced-Learn
* Pandas, Numpy
* Seaborns and MatPlotLib for data plotting

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

This project is meant to be a starting reference for my journey towards becoming a better ML engineer. It shows a basic understanding of data processing and pre-processing, prediction using some common ML models, and space-time optimization.
